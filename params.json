{"google":"","name":"Git4bigdata","tagline":"","body":"### Intro\r\nVersion control (VC) has been a mainstay of software development for [40 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System), but recent advances in VC frameworks, namely the distributed model popularized by Git, offer opportunities to address many of the challenges faced by big data analysis. In addition to the traditional software development necessities of versioning and collaborative development, data analysis presents some unique demands of VC software. These are inherent to the analysis model, in which input data and parameters are processed to produce reports.\r\n\r\n1. Spawn multiple related analyses (child analyses) from a single template\r\n2. Update those children and generate reports automatically as the parent analysis is refined\r\n3. Bind or \"marry\" reports with the analysis software, input data, and parameters that were used to produce them\r\n4. Version large files\r\n5. Compare reports\r\n\r\nThis white paper will explore possible solutions offered by Git and related software for handling big data analysis, as well as identify some areas where further development is needed.","note":"Don't delete this file!
